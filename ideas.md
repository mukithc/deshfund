**Design Movement**: Contemporary Bangladeshi Modernism - blending traditional Bengali aesthetics with modern digital design

**Core Principles**:
- Cultural authenticity through color and pattern
- Asymmetric layouts inspired by traditional Bengali art
- Warmth and community-focused design
- Trust-building through transparency

**Color Philosophy**: 
- Primary: Deep emerald green (#006747) representing Bangladesh's lush landscape

**Signature Elements**:
- Subtle alpona (traditional Bengali folk art) patterns as background textures
- Rounded organic shapes mixed with sharp angular cards
- Gradient overlays with cultural color transitions

**Interaction Philosophy**: Smooth, confident transitions that feel like unfolding a story. Hover states reveal additional context with gentle scale and glow effects.

**Animation**: 
- Entrance: Diagonal slide-ins with slight rotation (3-5 degrees)
- Scroll: Parallax effects on hero images with subtle depth
- Interaction: Elastic bounce on CTAs, gentle pulse on investment amounts
- Transitions: 300-400ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1)

**Typography System**:
- Display: Playfair Display (700) for headlines - elegant serif conveying trust
- Body: Inter (400, 500) for readability

**Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism meets Financial Dashboard - raw, honest, data-forward design

**Core Principles**:
- Radical transparency through exposed data
- Bold, unapologetic typography
- High contrast for clarity
- Functional beauty through information density

**Color Philosophy**:
- Primary: Electric blue (#0066FF) representing digital innovation

- Accent: Neon lime (#CCFF00) for highlights and success states
- Neutrals: Pure white (#FFFFFF) and concrete gray (#E5E5E5)
- Emotional intent: Bold, transparent, modern, data-driven

**Layout Paradigm**: Grid-based modular system with thick borders (4-6px) separating content zones. Overlapping cards with drop shadows create depth hierarchy. Dashboard-style information density.

**Signature Elements**:
- Thick borders and hard shadows (8-12px offset)
- Monospace numbers for all financial data
- Exposed grid lines as visual guides
- Raw, unpolished aesthetic with intentional roughness

**Interaction Philosophy**: Immediate, snappy feedback. No unnecessary flourishes - every animation serves a functional purpose. Clicks feel mechanical and precise.

**Animation**:
- Entrance: Hard cuts with 0.1s fade-ins
- Scroll: Fixed position data bars that stick
- Interaction: Sharp 150ms transitions, no easing
- Transitions: Instant state changes with brief opacity fade

**Typography System**:
- Display: Space Grotesk (700, 900) for headlines - geometric brutalism
- Body: IBM Plex Sans (400, 500) for clarity
- Data: IBM Plex Mono (500) for all numbers and financial info
- Hierarchy: 4rem/2.5rem/1.125rem/0.875rem with tight 1.3 line-height
